        This is a quiz based on logarithms
        
        How logs work:
        
        There are three parts of a log; base, exponent and argument
        
        -   base is the number that has an exponent on it such as A in: A^b = c
        -   exponent is the power of the base such as b in: A^b = c
        -   argument is what the base to power of the exponent is equal to, such as c in: A^b = c
        
        All of this can be written in log form. This is what is looks like in log form: logA (c) = b
        
        
        The default parameters of this game are: max base = 10, max exponent = 5
        
        You can edit these by not choosing to use the default parameters, however i wouldn't go too high.
        Otherwise your questions might get a little difficult.
        
        I would only recommend going to a max base of 12 and maybe a max exponent of 6 if your up to it.
